The Grundig KS580 is a 10 speaker audio cabinet built in the early 1960s available with multiple accessories. [More info](https://www.example.com). Here I compile a list of references and build info chronicling my restoration of one of these cabinets and its associated electronics. This particular example has:
---
- Grundig NF-10 (stereo tube amp)
- Grundig HF-10 (AM FM radio)
- Grundig TM-45 (4-track player/recorder)
- Dual-1009 (record player)
- Grundig GDSM 202 (stereo microphone)
- UHER-CV140 (stereo amp. Did not originally come with the KS580)
